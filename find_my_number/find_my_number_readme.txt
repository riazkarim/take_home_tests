Assumptions/Notes:

1. A knight move can be executed in any order of horizontal and vertical moves. E.g. 2V + 1H === 1H + 2V. In effect, it is therefore valid to "travel" over the blank spots on the keypad while executing a knight move.
2. I'm able to use the lru_cache built into Python. If not, then my approach would be cache the calls using a suitably nested dict structure.
3. Some tests I used to validate my solution as I went are in the find_my_number_tests.py file.

Looking forward to receiving your feedback, and hopefully a discussion into additional nuances of this problem!
