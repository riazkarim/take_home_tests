# Solana Epoch Data Analysis Coding Exercise

## Objective
You are tasked with creating a Python script that interacts with Solana's public RPC to analyze rewards data for the most recently completed epoch.

## Requirements
- You should focus on **voting rewards** data for epoch 598 (assuming the current epoch is 599).
- Your script must calculate and output the following statistics:
  - The **total** amount of voting rewards distributed.
  - The **maximum** voting reward received by a single validator.
  - The **minimum** voting reward received by a single validator.
  - The **mean** (average) voting reward amount.
  - The **median** voting reward amount.
- Identify the validator (vote account) that received the largest **absolute commission** in SOL. This refers to the total commission amount, not the commission rate.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are required:
- A Github repo (or Gist) with the solution. 
- A paragraph or two explaining what kind of distribution voting rewards follow along with your interpretation as to why. This can be a Google Doc, a `md` file, or a Jupyter Notebook. Up to you.

Good luck!
