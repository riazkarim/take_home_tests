## Context

[Rated](rated.network) offers a solution to the poor contextualization of validator quality. The solution is centered around reputation scores for machines and their operators, starting with the Ethereum Beacon Chain. 

Rated seeks to embed a large swathe of available information from all layers of a given network, and compress it in an easily legible and generalizable reputation score that can act as an input to human workflows but most importantly, machines (e.g. an API that acts as an input to insurance or derivatives Smart Contracts).

This repo contains various coding exercises to assess level of competency in different aspects of the problems Rated is trying to solve.

Mainly:
- `eth`: checks for the ability to interpret specs, implement a simple pipeline and an API endpoint.
- `sol`: checks for the ability to interpret low level protocol specs, and present the results in a coherent way.
- `performance`: assesses the ability to implement high performance code in Python.
